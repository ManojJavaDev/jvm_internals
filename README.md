1. Basics of JVM
1.1. What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and why is it important?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables Java programs to run on any platform without modification. It acts as a bridge between the compiled Java bytecode and the underlying hardware. JVM ensures platform independence, memory management, and runtime optimizations like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
